Here is an **extended but still minimal and human-written GitHub description**, with **no icons** and clean academic tone:

---

## Repository Name

**Tic-Tac-Toe (2 Player)**

---

## Description

This project is a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe desktop application developed using Python and the Tkinter GUI library. The game provides a simple 3×3 grid where two users play alternately as Player X and Player O. Each move is validated to prevent overwriting existing cells.

The application automatically checks all possible winning conditions after every move, including rows, columns, and diagonals. When a player wins, a message dialog displays the result and the game board resets. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw and restarts.

The code follows an object-oriented structure, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. This project is suitable for beginners who want to learn event-driven programming, basic game logic, and GUI development using Python.
